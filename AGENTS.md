Guidance for future coding agents working in this repository.

## Issue Fixing Policy

- Unless the user explicitly asks for a temporary workaround, fix the root cause in the intended layer or contract.
- Avoid adding fallback paths, compatibility shims, feature flags, or temp solutions that mask a broken primary path.
- If fallback behavior is already product-specified, keep it narrow, documented, and tested; do not use it to avoid fixing the primary path.
