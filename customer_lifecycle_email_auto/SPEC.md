# Customer Lifecycle Email Auto SPEC

## What We Want To Achieve

Build a reviewable operating decision workflow that helps Growth, lifecycle marketing, and customer success teams move from raw signals to an explainable recommendation. Coordinate customer lifecycle outreach with LLM-generated messaging and delivery controls. The target customer should understand what changed, why the system recommended an action, and what evidence a human should review before acting.

## Customer Problem

Customer outreach changes as replies, segments, policies, and delivery state evolve; static templates miss timing, context, and governance. In a real customer environment, the pain is not only producing an answer; it is preserving context across changing inputs, exposing tradeoffs, and creating an audit trail that business, technical, or governance stakeholders can trust.

## Design Details

The blueprint is organized as a MirrorNeuron workflow with stable identity, configurable inputs, structured events, and a final artifact. The main agent role is Campaign planner, copywriter, policy checker, delivery executor, inbox responder. The workflow uses lifecycle campaign loop with inbox and delivery state and demonstrates LLM messaging, delivery integration, policy checks, and long-running campaign loop.

The design is intentionally adapter-friendly. The prototype can run with bundled, mock, or synthetic data even when the current code has not implemented every production integration. The customer-facing contract stays centered on the same concepts: load inputs, observe current state, choose or score an action, emit traceable events, and write an artifact a reviewer can inspect.

A representative scenario is: Synthetic customer snapshots flow through campaign planning, copy generation, policy checks, email execution, and reply handling.

## Input

The prototype accepts configuration for scenario identity, run controls, and domain inputs. Current adapters include `mock`, `json`, `file`, and `env_json`, so evaluators can start locally and later replace sample data with production data while preserving the same blueprint identity and output shape.

Important state inputs include the configured state metrics. Where the blueprint uses an action loop, the current action space includes the configured domain actions. For production use, the same contract should be fed by customer system-of-record data, business rules, approval policies, thresholds, and any regulated or safety-critical constraints needed for the operating environment.

## Output: Expected Customer Outcome

The expected customer outcome is prepared emails, sent-event logs, reply handling events, and campaign summaries. A useful run should show the starting context, the observations made during the workflow, the action or recommendation rationale, and the final artifact that a domain owner can review.

The customer should be able to answer: what happened, which inputs mattered, what the system recommended, what changed over time, what risks or exceptions remain, and what a human team should do next.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Decision quality: confirm the recommendation is plausible for the observed state, customer constraints, and available actions.
- Scenario sensitivity: verify that outputs change appropriately when inputs, thresholds, seed values, or operating assumptions change.
- State trajectory: inspect whether the configured state metrics move coherently across the workflow rather than appearing as disconnected summaries.
- Traceability: confirm every recommendation can be tied back to inputs, events, intermediate decisions, and final artifact fields.
- Human review fit: check whether the artifact matches the language, evidence, and next-step format the target team already uses.
- Operational readiness: validate latency, reliability, adapter behavior, permissions, privacy, and approval gates before using real customer data.
- Outcome measurement: compare recommendations against historical cases, expert review, known policies, or measured business outcomes.

## Result Artifacts To Inspect

Inspect the event stream for observations, decisions, errors, and handoffs. Inspect the result payload and final artifact for the recommended action, ranked options or findings, supporting rationale, state changes, and next steps.

When using the local run store, inspect `run.json`, `config.json`, `inputs.json`, `events.jsonl`, `result.json`, and `final_artifact.json`. These artifacts are the review surface for debugging the workflow, comparing scenarios, and deciding whether the blueprint is ready for a real adapter.

## Prototype Limits

The current blueprint is a product-facing template and may include mock data, deterministic simulation, simplified policies, placeholder integrations, or partial worker coverage. It is designed to show the customer problem, target workflow, and expected artifact even where production implementation still needs hardening.

Outputs are decision-support artifacts. They should not be treated as final financial advice, medical guidance, safety certification, compliance approval, or executable operating instruction without customer validation and human approval.

## Upgrade Path To Real Customer Use

Replace the sample customer snapshot with CRM data, add lifecycle events, tune policy gates, and connect approved email or Slack providers. Add customer-specific policies, review gates, exception handling, retention rules, and monitoring dashboards. Calibrate the workflow against historical data and expert judgment, then track acceptance rate, correction rate, latency, incident reduction, cost impact, and other outcome metrics that prove whether the workflow is helping.

## Product Narrative

This can become a vertical lifecycle-growth product because it connects agent reasoning to real delivery systems and customer state.
